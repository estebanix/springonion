        content: `Since we all make resolutions to improve our physical fitness at the beginning of the new year, let's prepare a spinach dish inspired by Popeye the Sailor. Today we're going to create Palak Tofu. Simmer the spinach leaves in water. In the process, cut your tofu and also let it cook so that it is soft like paneer cheese. When the tofu is cooked, set it aside. When the spinach is cooked, put it in a blender. Add a cup of water, chopped garlic, ginger, tomato and kesha (leave the kesha soaked in water for at least two hours beforehand). Then blend everything. Then fry the onions in a pan until golden. Add the curry powder, cumin, turmeric and black pepper. Stir for a while and add the spinach mix. Stir again and add the tofu. You can add more masala and coriander at the end. Voilà! You can join Popeye's team and whistle merrily into the wind. Serve with rice. Enjoy!`,
